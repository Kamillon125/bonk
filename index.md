## bonk's history

originally this section had a history of how bonk came to be, it talked about the layouts my friend and i had learnt and the issues we had with them. that's boring. let's instead talk about the previous, beta versions of bonk.

i wasn't sure if i should include this layout, as it was my first attempt at making one back in september last year. it ended up being awful.

the first bonk version ever, i wasn't quite satisfied with it and wanted to take bonk in a different direction. my bigget issue with this one was the amount of same finger bigrams[^2] and the middle fingers being pretty bad.

[^1]: bonk's beta name was greg
[^2]: pressing two keys in a row with the same finger
