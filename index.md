## Bonk's history

Originally this section had a history of how bonk came to be, it talked about the layouts my friend and i had learnt and the issues we had with them. That's boring. Let's instead talk about the previous, beta versions of Bonk.

I wasn't sure if I should include this layout, as it was my first attempt at making one back in september last year. Tt ended up not being good at all.

The first bonk version ever, I wasn't quite satisfied with it and wanted to take bonk in a different direction. My biggest issue with this one was the amount of same finger bigrams[^2] and the index finger usage feeling pretty bad.

This one was a fever dream, let's not talk about it.

Greggg (09.04.2022) <br>
It started looking a lot more like the final version, the only changes I made afterwards were within the index fingers.

Gregggg (14.04.2022) <br>
This version was made with the help of people from the Alternate Keyboard Layouts discord server, I mostly changed up the index fingers.



[^1]: Bonk's beta name was greg
[^2]: Pressing two keys in a row with the same finger
[^3]: To distinguish between the beta versions i kept adding one more g to every version of greg
