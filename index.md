## Bonk's history

Originally this section had a history of how bonk came to be, it talked about the layouts my friend and I had learnt and the issues we had with them. That's boring. Let's instead talk about the previous, beta versions of Bonk.

**Fishmak** *(12.09.2021)*<br>
I wasn't sure if I should include this layout, as it was my first attempt at making one back in september last year. It ended up not being good at all.

**Greg** [^2] *(08.04.2022)*<br>
The first bonk version ever, I wasn't quite satisfied with it and wanted to take bonk in a different direction. My biggest issue with this one was the amount of same finger bigrams [^3] and the index finger usage feeling pretty bad.

This one was a fever dream, let's not talk about it.

**Greggg** *(09.04.2022)*<br>
It started looking a lot more like the final version, the only changes I made afterwards were within the index fingers.

This version was made with the help of people from the Alternate Keyboard Layouts discord server, I mostly changed up the index fingers.

## How does Bonk deal with same finger bigrams?<br>
The alt layer changes what some letters do, admittedly I don't mind the same finger bigrams myself so I haven't messed around with this layer, but if you hold down AltGr (the right alt) some letters will change. Here is what the actual fully complete bonk layout looks like.

[^1]: I have not had it happen to me yet :(
[^2]: Bonk's beta name was greg
[^3]: Pressing two keys in a row with the same finger
[^4]: To distinguish between the beta versions i kept adding one more g to every version of greg
